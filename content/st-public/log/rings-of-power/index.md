*Marked watched on 2025.09.07*

Rings of Power is Amazon's interpretation of how some of the pivotal moments in history of Middle-earth transpired.
Centrally the show depicts forging of the rings, Eregion's fate, fall of NÃºmenor, and the arrival of the Istari.

Generally speaking the show is somewhat faithful to the spirit of the books, and the canonical outcomes, even if
it at times takes heavy liberties in how it tells the story and arrives at the canonical outcome.
It's a fun watch if not only for more content about Tolkien's world (although abridged and altered),
but also for the excellently depicted ambiance, environments, and costumes.
Basically, just treat it as entertainment, set your expectations low, and you'll have a good time watching it.

I watched the episodes one at a time in the evenings with a friend over the course of a few weeks, and without
doubt we'll be continuing when the season three is eventually (hopefully) released!

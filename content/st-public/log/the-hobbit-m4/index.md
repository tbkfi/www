*Marked watched on 2025.11.01*

We finally found some time with a friend to watch a fan-edit of Hollywood's rendition of
"The Hobbit" by Tolkien. The fan-edit has a runtime of around 4.5 hours, and it claims to cut out
a lot of the unneccessary action, goof, and Hollywood modifications out of the Hobbit movies.

I remember watching The Hobbit movies in IMAX when released in theaters back in 2012, or
whenever it was, and I can't say I found them to be a bad experience. Then again,
I hadn't actually read the book back then, so I couldn't really compare the two at the time.

The Hobbit as a book is much shorter than the Lord of the Rings trilogy (which is actually 6 books,
two in each trilogy part). The Hobbit's source material being only around a half of what is in one trilogy part
means that Hollywood really stretched the source material when they made The Hobbit into three movies.
People have theorised that this is because of reasons like marketing, mismanagement, or other assorted goals.
I'm sure there's some truth to those perspectives, but I'd also argue that The Hobbit being a slow burn
lends itself to a significantly longer runtime than the length of the source material would suggest.

The M4-edit actually felt, at times, too fast-paced for my taste and recollection of the book. Naturally
there's only so much a fan-edit can do. A lot of the issues with the movies are inherent to the actual releases.
It's not like an editor can add missing scenes or fix inherent detail that simply isn't present in the movie releases.
In fact the M4-edit is actually quite commendable in cleverly masking some storylines, characters, and interactions
entirely out of the movies, making the experience categorically more true to the story told in the book.
So from an authenticity point of view, it's a very successful project.

I just can't shake the feeling that the movie releases are "bad enough", that it's frankly impossible to fix them.
No matter how much you polish a turd, at the end of the day it'll still be a turd. Now, the movies aren't actually awful
for what they are, but they're definitely not true to the spirit of the author and the story he told and wanted to tell (from what I can interpret).

As such I would say that the M4-edit is an enjoyable watch in its own right for a more true-to-book experience, but if I were to watch
the movies again, I would simply prefer the official releases for their longer runtime. Completely accepting the fact that
The Hobbit movie trilogy is entirely its own thing, and that it has a strong Hollywood tint on everything. The book still wins, naturally,
and there is no question about that. In the event that I wasn't feeling like reading, I'd just listen to the Hobbit as an audiobook over the movies.

## Cookies, Tracking, Logging

Some variants of this website may utilise cookies to store credentials for webserver-gated access
to files and other available resources.

The public version of this website uses cloudflare insights to gather basic usage data. Its loading may be blocked
by the browser, browser extensions (ublock origin, noscript), or other network solutions if undesired.

Care is put into the content hosted on this website, so it doesn't load third-party
cookies or scripts when navigating on this site.

### WWW-variant

The WWW-variant of this website is reachable under the `www.tbk.fi` subdomain, and its
hosted on either [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).
Therefore some of the logging is done by the respective service according to their settings.

### DMZ-variant

The DMZ-variant of this website is reachable under the `www.dmz.tbk.fi` subdomain, and includes
full webserver-logging which stores visitor IPs and HTTP requests for 30 days, until the
log is rotated. Rotated logs get purged after another 30 days.

### LAN-variant

The LAN-variant of this website is reachable under the `www.lan.tbk.fi` subdomain from the
internal LAN subnet(s). Full network- and webserver logs are stored indefinitely.

## Javascript

This **website** does not require javascript to function. A `main.js` script is served to clients,
but it's entirely optional. It may contain some visual candy or other optional silly features.

## Abuse

Traffic logs can and will be used to report abusive or malicious traffic where possible.

Guess what. It's that time again when I get to clean up other people's subpar encoding jobs,
so I figured I'd go over my old tooling, refresh the code, and document the process while I'm at it.

Encoding audio (specially lossless) is much more simple than doing decent video filtering and encoding,
so I'm really confused as to why this topic continues to give people such a hard time.
But evidently it does, considering the amount of badly encoded and tagged files that are in circulation.

I store video game OSTs that I like on my media server, and often many of the track variants
are only available in the game files, and never make it to official releases. So the
only way to listen to the tracks aside from playing the game is to extract the audio
from the game files, and to process them into an archivable format. Some generous people
spend a decent chunk of their time going through the trouble of doing this, but the output
is often in questionable format, and use illegal metadata fields or encoding, and lacks loudness
normalisation per track and album.

## Processing Steps

I'll demonstrate the full process step by step for a lossless demo file (*È≥•„ÅÆË©©.flac*),
and at the end provide a full script that handles album directories for convenient batch processing.

*The demo file I'll use is actually properly encoded and tagged, I just grabbed something readily
available to illustrate the process!*

### PCM source and Data Integrity

If encoding to a lossless format like FLAC, you'd naturally want the original source file,
or something as close to it as possible. I start my encode process by restoring the processed
track into it's original WAV (PCM) format if it isn't already. This has two benefits, I discard all
the existing metadata that may be baked into the files and make sure all my files start from the same
"unaltered" point where only the signal is present.

Before I continue... Please don't encode lossy audio files (e.g. MP3, AAC, OPUS) into a lossless format,
it's stupid and misleading. You can't magically conjure up lost data by changing the codec, you'll only
bloat the output due to more inefficient encoding. There are technically some limited cases where doing
this makes sense, like re-mastering old audio tracks where the original masters are lost forever or otherwise
rendered inaccessible, but those people know what they're doing. If you have lossy files, be happy with them or source new rips.

Let's begin by making sure we have a clean and non-corrupted PCM file to work with:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Verify file integrity
# and meta fields, no output WAV.
flac --test "È≥•„ÅÆË©©.flac"

# Verify file integrity,
# and write output WAV.
flac --decode "È≥•„ÅÆË©©.flac"
```

Running flac with the decode flag, we get our desired output file `È≥•„ÅÆË©©.wav` (if integrity is ok).
If the integrity checks fail, you'll have to rip or source a replacement file.

Sometimes sourcing a replacement is not possible if a track is extremely rare, and in those cases you can try to
use the `--force` option to output the decoded file even if the integrity checks fail. You'd
then want to closely inspect the audio file for defects and playback errors. Even if slightly damaged,
a lossless encode is valuable, specially in the absence of alternatives. Just don't forget to someway
mark that the file should be replaced in the future when/if possible due to corruption, because
after encoding it to FLAC the embedded checksum will indicate the file as OK, because the
corrupted signal is the new comparison point for the fresh FLAC checksum.

Let's quickly compare the processed source FLAC and its decoded WAV output by their properties:

What's very evident is that we've lost our metadata (including embedded cover!) in the decode process.
This is desired, because we know that all our files will now be "clean" of any possibly
illegal meta fields that could cause problems due to unknown encoding, keys, or other format issues.
In other words, we have a clean base to work with when we later setup automatic tagging with
[Musicbrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/) and [Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/).

### Encoding to FLAC

I know how allergic people are to looking up official documentation, so here's the
[link](https://xiph.org/flac/documentation_format_overview.html) to the FLAC format.

Encoding the PCM file to FLAC is made very easy, and the default settings in the encoder are
well regarded as sane; but, we may be able to do better than just sane. Or at least try to understand
more about how the encoder behaves and what parameters affect the output.
Proper control of encoding options, inclusion of a seektable, correctly formatted metadata blocks and,
if desired, reasonable padding provide a more resilient, usable, smaller, and possibly more performant output file that will
last into the future.

Generally speaking the options you need to care about in the encoding process are:
*the sample format*, *channel layout*, *encoder effort*, and *block size*. You could also
optimise other exposed encoder settings, but you'd be splitting hairs for such a small
amount of size savings that it's not worth it for general use and archival.

Below is an example of how the two main encoder settings (effort, blocksize) affects output filesizes
in the case of my demo file when encoding with 'flac' specifically:

```
=== EFFORT 8 ===
bs 4096: 44.933938 MB <- winner!
bs 2048: 44.974756 MB
bs 1024: 45.188216 MB
bs 512:  45.656543 MB
bs 256:  46.515364 MB

=== EFFORT 4 ===
bs 4096: 45.087671 MB
bs 2048: 45.124839 MB
bs 1024: 45.338003 MB
bs 512:  45.811137 MB
bs 256:  46.677598 MB

=== EFFORT 2 ===
bs 4096: 46.392430 MB
bs 2048: 46.400454 MB
bs 1024: 46.492873 MB
bs 512:  46.731520 MB
bs 256:  47.246093 MB
```

Quite predictably more "effort" results in a smaller output file. And in this case, of the tested
blocksizes 4096 came out ahead with best compression performance.

If you're working on a massive project with hundreds of thousands to millions of audio tracks, you'd
naturally want to optimise the hell out of each and every encode and only store the best output.
This would require automating the output filesize tests for the encode process, or curating a set
of library-specific encoding options that, in general, produce the best results for a genre of content.
While fun, definitely an overkill for my small library. I also want to stick to multiples of 4096
because my storage backend and network mounts use its multiples.

For my uses simply maxing out the effort and using 4096 as the blocksize is enough to get good
results semi-reliably (most of the time). And even if it misses a bit, it's not by much.

A general purpose encoding loop could look something like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

OUT_DIR="output"
mkdir "$OUT_DIR"

echo ">>> Encoding to FLAC"
shopt -s nocaseglob
for SRC in *.{wav,aiff,alac,flac}; do
	[[ -e "$SRC" ]] || continue
	FLAC="$OUT_DIR/${SRC%.*}.flac"
	T_START=$(date +%s)
	
	echo -n " * $SRC -> $FLAC ... "
	
	# FLAC already exists?
	if stat "$FLAC" &> /dev/null ; then
		echo "EXISTS"
		continue
	fi
	
	# Detect original sample format
	# see: https://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/7.0/group__lavu__sampfmts.html
	SAMPLE_FMT=$(ffprobe -v error -select_streams a:0 \
		-show_entries stream=sample_fmt \
		-of default=nokey=1:noprint_wrappers=1 "$SRC")
	
	PCM_FMT=""
	case "$SAMPLE_FMT" in
		s16) PCM_FMT=pcm_s16le ;;
		s24) PCM_FMT=pcm_s24le ;;
		s32) PCM_FMT=pcm_s32le ;;
		flt|fltp) PCM_FMT=pcm_s24le ;; # float-packed, float-planar
		dbl|dblp) PCM_FMT=pcm_s32le ;; # double-packed, double-planar
		*) PCM_FMT=pcm_s16le ;;
	esac
	
	# Detect channel layout and encode to FLAC
	ffmpeg -loglevel -8 -n -i "$SRC" \
		-af 'aformat=channel_layouts=mono|stereo|5.1|6.1|7.1' \
		-c:a "$PCM_FMT" -f wav - \
	| flac --best --blocksize=4096 --verify -o "$FLAC" - &>/dev/null
	ENC_RC=$?
	
	T_ELAPSED=$(( $(date +%s) - $T_START ))
	
	if (( $ENC_RC )); then
		echo "FAIL ($T_ELAPSED seconds)"
		continue
	else
		echo "OK ($T_ELAPSED seconds)"
	fi
	
	# Padding, Seektable
	metaflac --remove-all --dont-use-padding "$FLAC"
	metaflac --add-seekpoint=2s "$FLAC"
	metaflac --merge-padding "$FLAC"
    metaflac --sort-padding "$FLAC"
done
shopt -u nocaseglob
echo "DONE"
```

This script combines conversion to WAV before piping into `flac` for encoding, with intermediary steps to guess
proper channel layout and retain the original sample format via `ffprobe`.
The script therefore should also work for movie tracks with surround sound and other special releases
in addition to regular albums and EPs.

Let's see what the resulting FLAC file looks like after running the demo file through the previous script:

The resulting FLAC file has the correct length, channel configuration, sampling rate, bit depth, and the FLAC metadata is clean with a seektable and no padding.

As an additional test I picked up a demo multi-channel fltp audio track from the Internet
to verify the script correctly preserves channel configuration and sample format.
Here are the original attributes of this other demo file (`dts-51.wav`):

*I couldn't find a MA (Master Audio) DTS track off the cuff, and didn't feel like ripping
one from a bluray for this, so I demoed on a lossy track. But the point still stands.*

```

We can again confirm that important characteristics like duration, sampling rate, bit depth,
and channel layout were preserved correctly during the encode. The printed layout ordering is
slightly different, but this is normal and doesn't affect the playback or the channel data itself.

### Loudness data (ReplayGain / EBU R 128)

The last "manual" step before mass tagging the albums/songs involves adding track and album specific loudness metadata.
This just makes listening to tracks and albums more pleasant through equalising the perceived loudness across
your audio library.

I like to use a program called `rsgain`. It supports both [ReplayGain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReplayGain)
and [EBU R 128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBU_R_128), and its easy to invoke.
Simply selecting the desired preset and pointing it at a directory (e.g. album) will make it
process each track separately and apply individual tags and album-specific loudness metadata
to all the tracks.

Below is an example on triggering rsgain for an album, and what the process output and resulting
metadata looks like:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Process all files in 'output/',
# and use the EBU R 128 preset.
rsgain easy -p ebur128 "output/"
```

```
$ rsgain easy -p ebur128 "World of Warcraft Taverns of Azeroth/"

With that your albums should be equalised for loudness quite nicely. Yay for no more blown
ear drums when the songs change, or albums switch.

### Music Metadata via MusicBrainz

Tagging the music is quite an endeavour on its own, even with the help of databases like
MusicBrainz and tools like Picard.

I would recommend batch processing multiple albums into an ingest directory, and then using
Picard's graphical UI to apply any changes in bulk once you've accumulated enough new albums.
Always giving a visual pat-down of any new changes is a good idea, the matching isn't perfect.

You can tune the settings in-application easily, and dictate what kind of album metadata and art should
be applied from the public database to your files. But don't embed images into the files directly!
A single high-quality cover art image at the root of the album titled `cover.jpg` is the most efficint way
of handling cover art. There's no sense in duplicating a high-quality 5MB cover art into every song in the album,
when one separate image is enough.

Also, If you see any missing data in the public database (missing albums, song metadata, etc.), don't
be afraid to contribute to the database. The account is free to create and it's better there is
some information than none available for a release, that way people know a release at least exists!

If you're entirely new to the site, try to apply the monkey-see monkey-do approach and see how other people have
added or edited releases in the past (specially the trusted contributors!). That'll get you close enough to get started,
the rest of the style guides you can ape directly from the official [MusicBrainz contributing guidelines](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/How_to_Contribute).

## Automated script

All right, now to smash it all together into a workflow and script that is easy to use.

- The workflow
    - [1] Create an Album specific directory
    - [2] Move all Album tracks into the directory
    - [3] Rename tracks and add track numbers
    - *Repeat for all the albums you wish to process*

Now you should have a directory that looks something like:

```
$ tree ./input

encode-my-stuff.sh
input/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ album1
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01. TRACK.wav
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02. AnOtHeR TRACK.wav
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 03. Yep.wav
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ album2
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 01. È≥•„ÅÆË©©.flac
```

Next step is to run the script I've written below by passing it the full path of your ingest
directory (e.g. `bash encode-my-stuff.sh /home/user/music/ingest`). You can also not pass the
directory path, and it'll look for a dir named *input* at present working dir, and complain if it can't
find one.

The script just reads every track in an album directory inside the ingest directory, and creates a copy of the
structure while encoding all matched tracks into the output location. This way you can decide for yourself
when you're happy to nuke the source files.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

encode_lossless_audio() {

	# Require existence and access of and to SOURCE DIRECTORY
	SRC_PATH="$1";
	if [[ -z "$SRC_PATH" ]]; then

	done
	shopt -u nocaseglob
	echo -e "DONE\n"
	
	# Loudness normalisation
	echo ">>> Applying Loudness Metadata"
	echo ">> target: '$SRC_PATH'"
	if command -v rsgain &> /dev/null; then
		[[ -d "$OUT_DIR" ]] || return
		rsgain easy -p ebur128 "$OUT_DIR"
		echo -e "DONE\n"
	else
		echo -e "SKIP, NO RSGAIN BINARY\n"
		continue
	fi
}

if [[ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" == "$0" ]]; then
	
	# Accept passed argument as
	# an input directory.
	if [[ -z "$1" ]]; then
		IN_DIR="$PWD/input"
	else
		IN_DIR="$1"
	fi
	
	echo ">>> Lossless Audio Encoding Script"
	echo " * input root: '$IN_DIR'"
	if ! [[ -d "$IN_DIR" && -r "$IN_DIR" ]]; then
		echo "EXIT, NO ACCESS TO INPUT ROOT!"
		exit
	fi
	
	# Pass subdirectories in input root
	# for processing via script.
	for DIR in "$IN_DIR"/*; do
		[[ -d "$DIR" ]] || continue
		encode_lossless_audio "$DIR"
	done
fi
```

To support multi-disc releases and an album structure where each disc is a nested directory
inside the album root, you'd have to modify the script to use find or fd-find or some such tool
and slightly change the parsing. What I wrote is just a quick and dirty way to get the job done.

That's all.

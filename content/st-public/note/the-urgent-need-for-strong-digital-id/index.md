As Europe and its remaining partners prepare to truly counter the enemy's disinformation and
attempts at division, it has become painfully clear that one of the strongest, and currently missing,
defenses is a transparent, reliable, and verifiable chain of trust for public discourse.
A strong digital ID for each constituent that is mandated on trusted social platforms for people that wish
to actively participate, but crucially **NOT** required for private person-to-person messaging.
That last part is critical for the system to remain effective, more on that later.

Effectively all social media platforms have been and are currently running entirely without firewalls
against bots and bad actors.
This is a ludicrous state of affairs from a security and usability point of view,
as it allows those with an agenda to freely propagate their messaging without checks or the risk
of being held accountable --both in good and bad. 

Barring unauthorised, untrusted, and unidentified agents from the trusted platform at the gates is
quite literally one of the most simple and effective ways of curbing the tactics that Russia, China,
and others employ to destabilise and divide *people* for their own authoritarian goals. Removing this capability
alone will obliterate the enemy's ability to project their strategic goals of information warfare, as
the bad actors currently rely chiefly on the quality of quantity and the statistical gains this spamming on
the free Internet provides through uncertainty and numbing in and of the reader --many publications are also culpable
in this, either directly (paid, deliberate propaganda, etc.) or indirectly (incompetence, prejudice, etc.).

The glaring downside to this type of identification obviously being, that now everything people do online
on these platforms is verifiably tied to them and trackable --and there is no guarantee that this data wouldn't eventually (lol) be
weaponised to the constituents' detriment, be it politically, economically, or socially. It's therefore
vital to limit the scope of the application (identification) to select platforms or areas of a platform,
and **NOT MAKE IT MANDATORY ACROSS THE ENTIRE INTERNET**. Just give the decent people a chance to interact
with each other in a secure and trusted setting without the miscreants, and it will in time flourish.

Another chief concern is the ultimate root of trust. Authoritarians would and do salivate over the prospect
of controlling this kind of ultimate source of truth. It's therefore important to realise the need for the
collective truth to be comprised of many independent and intertwined perspectives and chains of authenticity
that, even independently, maintain sufficient resiliency to targeted attacks.
In practical terms this means each democratic country should maintain their own systems and **NEVER** yield
that digital sovereignty to anyone or anything else (e.g. The European Union), as this introduces a massive lynchpin
vulnerability that may destroy the entire system *when* compromised or affected by the enemy (because everything falters at times).

Strong digital ID is a weapon. It is devastatingly powerful in its application, and it should only be wielded
as a precision instrument by those who understand the weight of exercising that power. As war approaches,
brandishing the weapon has not only become a morally valid option, but a neccessity for survival.

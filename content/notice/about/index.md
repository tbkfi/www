## Security

All information hosted on this website is considered public information.
Some content is restricted at the author's discretion to be only served from fully-controlled servers,
and will be available under a separate subdomain.

The fully-controlled subdomain servers take advantage of various blocklists (e.g. [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home), 
[Emerging Threats](https://community.emergingthreats.net/), [Spamhause](https://www.spamhaus.org/), etc.) to secure the server.

The fully-controlled subdomain server network is configured to block at least the following countries
due to repeated and persistent malicious behaviour: Russia, Hungary, China, Iran, and India.

The Cloudflare Pages hosted public variant of the website is access-controlled by Cloudflare's webservers.

communicate without communicating... You know?

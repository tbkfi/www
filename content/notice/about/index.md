## Ownership

This is a personal website currently available under the domain `tbk.fi`, authored by
Tuomo Bj√∂rk.

All opinions expressed therein are my own, and listening to me is done at your own peril.

## Security

All data stored and configured to be accessible via the `WWW-variant` and `DMZ-variant` of this site
is considered public information, with the exception of some stored log data such as IP-addresses of inbound connections.

The author controlled variants of this website are hosted on servers that are configured to take advantage of the *GeoIP database*,
*Emerging Open Threats rulesets*, and other means to outright block access from certain countries, malicious host networks and addresses,
certain user agents, and requests that are detected to be malicious in nature. This results in the website and its host
not being visible to some networks and clients *by choice* of the administrator.

For any queries regarding security or content violation, please be in touch with the domain administrator at the mailbox **admin** of this domain **tbk.fi**. Spam to this address will be promptly reported to upstream mailmasters.

## Purpose

This website has no other stated purpose than to operate in a hobby-centric capacity. Content is 
categories into `posts`, `notes`, and `logs`.

Depending on the access-level the website is built with different amount of content
visible to the end-user.

### Posts

This category is supposed to contain some of the more "coherent" content pieces that make
up a cohesive package. Ideally full project writeups and the like.

### Notes

A note could be anything between a personal note on a project, a piece of software, or a
passing thought on some subject.

### Logs

Logs are simple entries of read books, watched movies, or played games. That sort of
thing. And in scope they might be nothing more than a single line, or a more thorough
review.
